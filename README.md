WEBSITE DESIGN & CORRELATIONS

Overview
The website’s design is meant to embody and represent the video game in terms of a proxy and source of information regarding the video game itself. Not only that but to serve as a basis to allow the users to experience the website and keep up with updates as well as development phases for the video games. From beta testing to asset creation, porting and cross-platform compatibility.
Schematics
•	Design
o	Responsive
o	Dynamic
•	Design Trends included 
o	Dynamic Gradient (Rocheleau, 2017)
   Purple and orange
•	Due to colour scheme of the main game presentation image
   Purple and Blue
•	Using different shades to convey different aspects of website and to give the website a more cyber-punk and robust tone with a more darker suited format (user), 2017)
o	Integrated animations
	Menu transitions and also sub-menu transitions
 Loading screens and other features
•	Layout
o	Conventional Top Page Navigation Bar that blends with the backgrounds colour
o	Content is structured across the entire screen and isn’t only centred for more freedom of where to place content
o	Page Numbers: 3-5
	Home page
	Core video game information including an update section on development progress
	External market related video game information
	External links and iframes coupled with videos and a minor gallery section
	Any other relevant page we may deem necessary
•	Frameworks
o	Bootstrap
Final Design Schematics
Included below
These are:
•	The index page
•	The core game content page
•	The marketing related game content page
 
This is the Index page, fitted with a simply nave bar at the top and a boxy content wrapper that encapsulates a two sectioned div coupled with a heading at the top. We hope to be able to fully implement these dynamic gradients as seen in this screenshot, and as such we’ll be including an image of a robotic model from the video game to serve as an opaque background that seamlessly blends in with the colours

 
This is the core game content page which contains for divisions across the page, with each division highlighting an important section of the page. Naturally upon clicking and div, it should expand and reveal underlaying content, since we had been wanting to include integrated animations.
 
This page is the marketing related game content page, divided into two primary sections, the one on the left for news and information and the one on the right reactions and reviews, naturally we’ll be sourcing this information from external websites and hopefully integrate it well into the system.
Inspiration and sources
For our sources and inspiration with regards to references made in terms of the design and structure, it was all conceived by our selves. We decided not to mimic any existing design and to truly try and come up with one entirely on our own, by using past experiences in terms of design related material gone we have gone through throughout the years with our IMY modules and also negating unnecessary information by keeping content relevant and intact.
